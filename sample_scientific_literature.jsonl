The mechanism relies on guide RNA (gRNA) to direct the Cas9 endonuclease to the target DNA sequence. Efficiency can be influenced by PAM sequence context and chromatin accessibility. Equation example: $E = mc^2$ represents mass-energy equivalence, often used in biophysical modeling.", "citations": [{"author": "Doudna", "year": 2014, "doi": "10.1126/science.1258096"}, {"author": "Charpentier", "year": 2012, "doi": "10.1038/nature12312"}], "domain": "Biology"}
