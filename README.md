This dataset provides sample scientific literature records across Biology, Chemistry, and Physics for testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Each record includes a research title, concise abstract, detailed main text with LaTeX-formatted mathematical equations, and structured citations with author, year, and DOI metadata.

The dataset is designed to support:

Experimentation with retrieval algorithms (BM25, dense embeddings, hybrid search)

Evaluation of domain-specific LLM responses with accurate scientific references

Demonstration of end-to-end RAG pipelines in academic and research contexts

Its balanced coverage of multiple domains, inclusion of technical terminology, and equation-rich content make it ideal for prototyping, benchmarking, and educational purposes in scientific NLP and AI research.
